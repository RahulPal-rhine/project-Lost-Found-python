Python-based project to generate QR code for the data entered in Google form
#Lost No More: Revolutionizing Crowd Control with Tech

I'm excited to share my latest project which aims to enhance safety and security at large-scale events.

The Challenge:
Large-scale events, especially religious gatherings, often see millions of attendees. The risk of individuals, particularly the elderly and children, getting lost is a significant concern.

The Solution:
I developed a system that leverages technology to address this challenge:

▶ Data Collection: A simple Google Form collects essential information from attendees, including name, age, contact details, and location.

▶ Data Storage: The collected data is automatically stored in a Google Sheet, ensuring efficient organization.
▶ Data Integration: Using Google Sheets API and Python, the data is extracted and inserted into a MySQL database, optimizing data accessibility and security.
▶ QR Code Generation: A unique QR code is generated for each attendee, linking to their specific information in the database.
▶ Wristband Integration: These QR codes can be printed on wristbands, worn by attendees for easy identification.

The Impact:
By scanning the QR code, event organizers or anyone with scanner in phone can quickly access vital information about the lost individual, enabling swift reunification with their family or guardians. This innovative solution not only enhances safety but also provides peace of mind to attendees.
