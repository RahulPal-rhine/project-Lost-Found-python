Python-based project to generate QR code for the data entered in Google form
#Lost No More: Revolutionizing Crowd Control with Tech

I'm excited to share my latest project 🚀 which aims to enhance safety and security at large-scale events.

The Challenge:
Large-scale events, especially religious gatherings🙏, often see millions of attendees. The risk of individuals, particularly the elderly 👴👵 and children 👶, getting lost is a significant concern.🆘

The Solution:
I developed a system that leverages technology to address this challenge:

▶ Data Collection: A simple Google Form collects essential information from attendees, including name, age, contact details, and location.📍

▶ Data Storage: The collected data is automatically stored in a Google Sheet, ensuring efficient organization. 🗂️

▶ Data Integration: The data is extracted and inserted into a MySQL database using Google Sheets API and Python, optimizing data accessibility and security.🔒

▶ QR Code Generation: A unique QR code is generated for each attendee, linking to their specific information in the database.🔗

▶ Wristband Integration: These QR codes can be printed on wristbands, and worn by attendees for easy identification.👀

The Impact:
By scanning the QR code, event organizers or anyone with a scanner in their phone📱 can quickly access vital information about the lost individual, enabling swift reunification with their family or guardians. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 This innovative solution not only enhances safety 🦺 but also provides peace of mind to attendees.🙏

# STEPS
1️⃣ Fill out the Google form

![google_form](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49600697-35fa-41c2-a924-f251435144b4)

2️⃣ Responses will get stored in Google sheet

3️⃣ Fetching data from Google sheet into Python program through Google Sheet API

4️⃣ Check if the data has been stored in MySQL Workbench database table to avoid duplication of the records through unique ID

5️⃣ After the running the python program, QR code in png format will be generated for each new records

6️⃣ Scan the QR code to see if the data entered in the google form matches.
